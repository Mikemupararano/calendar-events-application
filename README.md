# Calendar-events-applications


## Description 
I designed a calendar events scheduler for the hours spanning from 9AM to 5PM. The application allows users to enter their task for the day in a given time slot. 
The web application uses Day.js to handle dates and time. The good news is that if a time slot is in the past, it is colour-coded gray. A current time slot is shaded in a red background and any future time slots appear in a green background colour.

The user can write tasks in future time slots and the data is saved to a local storage.

When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist
 The application has a visual appeal and guides them to give first priority to the current and future time slot tasks. 



The web application has been designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery and Google Fonts.
